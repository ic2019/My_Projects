Pymaceuticals Inc., a burgeoning pharmaceutical company based out of San Diego, CA. Pymaceuticals specializes in drug-based, anti-cancer pharmaceuticals. In their most recent efforts, they've since begun screening for potential treatments to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.

We have gathered complete data from their most recent animal study. In this study, 250 mice were treated through a variety of drug regimes over the course of 45 days. Their physiological responses were then monitored over the course of that time. My objective here is to analyze the data to show how four treatments (Capomulin, Infubinol, Ketapril, and Placebo) compare.

To do this you are tasked with:

#### Outputs and Trends/Insights.


* Tumor Response to Treatment

_Trends_: 

Based on the available data, it looks like treatment with Capomulin drug is giving the best results as there's a good reduction  (Alsmost 20%) in tumor volume towards the end of the treatment period of 45 days. With all other drugs, tumor volume shows consistent increase as the treatment period increases and can't be recommended.


* Metastatic Response to Treatment

_Trends_:

Based on the available data, we see rise in Metastatic spead for all treatment drugs but least amount of rise for Capomulin with followed with Infubinol. It could be that Capomulin is more effective for curing the tumor at a specific location and the Metastatic spread could be lined with many other factors like average health of patient prior to starting treatment or how well patient is responding to treatment etc.


* Survival Rates

Based on the available data, again Capomulin drug seems to be the most effective one while analysing the survival rates of mouse over 45 days of treatment showing almost 85%. All other drugs showing survival rate of less than 45%.

_Trends_:

* Tumor change over 45 days Treatment

![Change](Images/tumorChange45Days.png)

_Trends_:

Based on the available data, Tumor volume on average shows a reduction of 19% for Capomulin drug whereas all other 3 drugs showing similar increase in Tumor volume between 45 and 60%. This again indicates that, it's recommnded to contunie treatment with Capomulin for this skin cancer treatment.
There were a total of 10 drugs used for treatment but the study is only done for 4 of them. It's worthwhile to investigate the results from remaining 6 drugs also to understand the trend.
